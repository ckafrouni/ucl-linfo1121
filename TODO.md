  * [ ] Complexity

A priority queue is a special type of queue data structure where each element is associated with a
priority. The priority of the elements in a priority queue determines the deletion order. The element with the
highest priority is deleted first. In case elements have the same priority, they are served according to their
ordering in the queue.
